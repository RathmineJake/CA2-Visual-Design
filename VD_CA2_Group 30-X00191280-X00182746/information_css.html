                <h2>Inconsistency</h2>
                <p>The example of css styling is apperant when simple structures are taken away such as simply removing the box shadow and border color, makes it so that everything looks the same even if they within different containers</p>
                <ul id="list_type">
                    <li id="randomcolorA">Poor use of Color whether your using color to highlight important information or to divide areas the key aspect to is that it is must be constant in your use of Color</li>
                    <li>The use of color should be considered with the other elements around your webpage, we've made the line above a much harder color to see with its background to show Inconsistency</li>

                <h2>What determines the style and layout of a page?</h2>
                    <p>Simply put it is the user who determines the the relative content studies show that we don't read webpages we scan them for what it is we are looking for</p>
                    <p><strong>So simply making something stand out slightly will draw in your user's attention</strong></p>

                <h2>Layout</h2>
                    <p>You've got text align more to the right a highlight useless piece of information the flow of this layout is chatoic and something which should always be avoided</p>
                    <p>Like we talked about before there are three constant question which you should always be referring back to</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How many classes are needed to achieve the style?</li>
                    <li>How long and complex are each of the classes?</li>
                    <li>Are the class name easily understandable without context?</li>

                <h2 id="menu1">Consistency</h2>
                    <p>Choose your methodology or framework and stay consistent with your rules when coding the web layout of the CSS.</p>
                    <p>With a poorly-designed system it will break down immediately.</p>
                    <p>Pick you methodology and framework (or a lack of one), and when your confident in your choices, put your head down,get to work and be predictable and consistent.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="content-2">
                <h2 id="menu2">Succinctness</h2>
                    <p>What does it mean? <br>To be brief <strong>and</strong> clear, in other words, keep it simple enough to understand.</p>
                    <p>You don't want to write a complicated CSS system otherwise other developers will find it hard to follow it consistently and unaminously.</p>
                    <p>When implementing styles in CSS, ask yourself the three questions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How many classes are needed to achieve the style?</li>
                        <li>How long and complex are each of the classes?</li>
                        <li>Are the class name easily understandable without context?</li>

                 <h2 id="menu3">Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                 <p>Visual Hierarchy is the arrangement of elements in order of importance.This can be done by:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Sizing_items_in_CSS"><li>Size</li></a>

                <h2 id="menu4">Mobile Friendly</h2>
                <p>With many people using their, it is important to consider buidling your website with a responsive layout where your website can adjust to different screen.</p>
